# Sprites

**As a general rule of thumb, please check the current sprites to gain an idea of our art style.**

## General

- original content

## Size

- tag Icon: 128x128 (canvas size; the object does not have to take all space - the larger the sexier though!)
- tag World: 48x48 (same as above; for tall objects such as trees the 48px height limit can be extended)

## Format

- transparent background
- PNG format

## Style

- pixel-art (1x1 pixels)
- realistic style
- small palettes

## Don'ts

- no strong outlines
- no photorealism
- no gradients

## Icon Tag

Icons are very likely to be a part of the UI, such as inventory images of items. This means the object can be drawn from any angle without any restrictions.

## World Tag

Objects with the tag World are to be part of the ingame world. Shocking, huh? We feature an **isometric** (or 3/4) view, so please make sure the sprite is in the correct angle.

## File Location

As long as you put your sprite in the sprites/ folder, it is fine. Place where it feels logical within, but we will take care of sorting that.
